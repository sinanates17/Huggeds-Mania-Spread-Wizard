# Mapset Statistician

## About
- Mapset Statistician is a modding tool for osu!mania that allows the user to graph certain characteristics of difficulties in a mapset next to each other for comparison.
- This application is **NOT** a problem detector. It's meant to provide general diagnostic information about the difficulties in a mapset to aid the modder in finding issues.
- Please read the documentation. There are sliders and options whose functions aren't immediately clear. The documentation explains them.
- This application is still in dev. There is no executable available for the end-user yet. A first version will be released soon.
